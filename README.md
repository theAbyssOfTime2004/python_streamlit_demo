# python_streamlit_demo
A demo streamlit app for the finalterm of my python class, the project is about crawling data from a website and creating chatbot to do QnA from that data.
In my work, i have developed a chatbot following the basic structure of RAG using langchain and API from Google for gemini llm and gemini text embedding model.
For crawling data, i've used api from opengraph.io to extract the site as requirement. \n
